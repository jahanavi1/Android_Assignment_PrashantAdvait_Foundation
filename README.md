#Tasks:

* Image Grid: Show a 3-column square image grid. The images should be centercropped.
* Image Loading: Implement asynchronous image loading using this url.
* Display: User should be able to scroll through at least 100 images.
* Caching: Develop a caching mechanism to store images retrieved from the API in
both memory and disk cache for efficient retrieval.
* Error Handling: Handle network errors and image loading failures gracefully when
fetching images from the API, providing informative error messages or placeholders
for failed image loads.
* Implementation to be done in Kotlin or Java using Native technology.

Note : Here, covering all above point and create small app to loading image with 2 ways..

1. Without Thirdparty Using Cache/Disk though
- Using Retrofit though get the record
- Using Jetpack Compose
- Android Clean Architecture
- Error Handling.. when we get empty image url or invalid image url in that case we are showing place holder image
- implemented in Kotlin
- Using asynchronous image(Coroutines)
- Here, Using Lazy Loading.


2. With Thirpary Using Coill
- Using Retrofit though get the record
- Using Jetpack Compose
